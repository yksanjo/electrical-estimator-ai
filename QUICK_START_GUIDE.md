Hi [Name],

I built EstimateAI specifically for electrical contractors.

It uses AI to analyze blueprints and generate material lists automatically.
Most contractors spend 3-5 hours per estimate. This does it in 30 minutes.

Would you be interested in trying it? First month is free.

Best,
[Your name]

I just launched EstimateAI - an AI tool for electrical contractors.

After talking to electricians, I learned they spend 3-5 hours on each blueprint estimate.
That's crazy when AI can do it in 30 minutes.

So I built it. It's live today.

If you know any electrical contractors, send them my way!
