## MESSAGING THAT WORKS

**Subject Line**: "Save 5 hours per estimate"

**Email Template**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I built EstimateAI specifically for small
electrical contractors.

I noticed [Company Name] does [commercial/residential] work in
[City]. I built a tool that does blueprint takeoffs in 30 seconds.

Upload a blueprint → AI counts outlets, switches, lights, panels
→ Get material list

Most contractors spend 3-5 hours per estimate. This does it in
30 seconds.

Want to try it? No credit card, just upload a blueprint:
[Link to demo]

If it saves you time, it's $99/month. If not, no worries.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
```

## OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**"Too expensive"**
→ "How much is your time worth? If you're billing at $100/hr and this saves 5 hours, that's $500 saved per estimate. At $99/month, you break even after 1 estimate."

**"I don't trust AI"**
→ "I get it. That's why we show you the blueprint with AI annotations so you can verify every count. You're still in control, but you save 80% of the time."

**"I'm used to my current process"**
→ "Makes sense. How many more bids could you submit if estimating took 30 minutes instead of 5 hours? Most contractors tell us they can bid on 2-3x more projects."

**"Let me think about it"**
→ "Totally understand. What would you need to see to feel confident? Happy to do a live demo with one of your actual blueprints."

- **McCormick**: $1,500+/year (established)

**Your Advantage**:

- ✅ **100x easier**: Upload blueprint vs learning complex software
- ✅ **AI-powered**: Instant counts vs manual entry
- ✅ **Modern**: Cloud-based vs desktop software from 2005
